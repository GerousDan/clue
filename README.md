# cluesolver
Application to take information about a Clue/Cluedo game in progress and make deductions

This is the source for the [clue solver](https://gregstoll.com/cluesolver/) site.  `index.html` is the main page that includes the React UI (inline because I was lazy), `clue.py` is the CGI script that the UI calls into, and `clueengine.py` has all of the logic. (and unit tests)
