        <div id="main"></div>
        <p id="about"><b>About this project:</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo">Clue</a> (or Cluedo outside of North America) is a game published
by Hasbro in which players make accusations to try to determine who killed Mr.
Boddy.  This application takes information about the game (including what cards
you have and which suggestions are disproved by whom) to figure out who has
which cards, and thus who the killer is.</p>
        <p>To get a quick start, load one of these sample clue games and play around with the Game Info and Simulations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>63-QLU.3-ANQIHOLUMG.3-QLU-AMG-ANH-AOI.3QLU-AFECSNBTIHKOGRPMJD.3-QLU.3-QLU.3-QLU.</li>
            <li>54TNJS-AFECBIHKOLURQPMGD.4-ANSTOJ-FHP.4-ANSTOKJP.3-FNSHTJP-AO-AK.3-FNSHTJP.3-TNJS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The front-end was developed using the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>, the back-end is written in Python, and
they communicate in the <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a> data format.
This was my first project using the Google Web Toolkit, and I didn't spend a lot
of time prettying things up, etc.</p>
        <p>I originally tried to write the back-end using first-order logic (see
<a href="http://gregstoll.livejournal.com/tag/cluesolver">discussions on my
LiveJournal</a>), and then propositional logic, but ended up rolling my own
deduction, which was sort of disappointing.</p>
        <p>The simulations are only reliable to within a few percent (it only
does 2000 of them) - basically it chooses each possible solution, tries to
assign cards to each player and sees if the solution is consistent or not (and if so, counts it).</p>
        <p>The name suggestions are taken from <a href="http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/names_files.html">popular names from the 1990s census</a> - I took the top 750 for males and females.</p>
